# Test environment for ENGIE's messages distribution system

Node.js app for mocking a web service that will be implemented by Engie's engineers. This is needed at the client implementation stage for testing and debugging the client app (running on kiosk devices and led panels) and the REST API defined beforehand the actual server app implementation.

## Quickstart

[Visit the tutorial online](https://closebrace.com/tutorials/2017-03-02/the-dead-simple-step-by-step-guide-for-front-end-developers-to-getting-up-and-running-with-nodejs-express-and-mongodb). The rest of the project is provided just to show the functioning finished results. The tutorial will show you how to build all of this stuff, from downloading Node all the way to the end.

If you want to run this example code, you will need to do an NPM Install, as the node_modules directory has been removed from this repository. You'll also need to set up a MongoDB database. I highly recommend just going through the tutorial!
